I am using <i>Coryphopterus hyalinus</i>/<i>personatus</i> as a model system to understand these dynamics because, despite being generally poorly studied these two species contain characteristics making them an ideal study system for these questions. Namely, an abundant, short-lived sedentary adult life-history combined with generally localized dispersal behaviour.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n\n***\n\n### **What are the evolutionary impacts of living near close relatives?**\n\n<!-- body text about the general research of the lab (size set in style.css), the * * around a word make the word italicized-->\n<br><br><br>\n<table class=\"image\" align=\"right\">\n<caption align=\"bottom\">Family Networks of <i>C. hyalinus</i>.</caption>\n<tr><td><img src=\"images/family_network.png\" align=\"right\" width=\"250\" height=\"300\" style=\"padding: 10px\"></td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- <table class=\"image\" align=\"right\"> -->\n<!-- inserts a table of class image and aligns that table to the right (formatting corresponds to the table tag set in css above, although currently only set for when the screen size is small)-->\n\n<!-- <caption align=\"bottom\">Top picture: *P. neomexicanus*, bee syndrome.

This finding has also led to another research interest of mine, what are the consequences of living with close relatives, good and bad?\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<!-- for each topic, I currently have set the image+caption (see above) then three breaks (this line) then a line (below) and then the next topic-->\n\n***\n\n### **What is \"good quality\" habitat from the perspective of <i>Coryphopterus hyalinus</i>/<i>personatus</i>?**\n<!--h3 header, 3rd biggest, size set in style.css, this is bolded as indicated by the ** ** around the words -->\n\n<table class=\"image\" align=\"left\">\n<caption align=\"bottom\">3D Model Belizean Reef</caption>\n<tr><td><img src=\"images/Habitat_Map.gif\" align=\"left\" width=\"225\" height=\"225\" style=\"padding: 10px\"></td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- image +caption being set as discussed above -->\n\nPart of understanding how habitat quality influences dispersal is to first understand what counts as \"good\" habitat from the perspective of the <i>Coryphopterus</i> themselves. To try and get a fish eye view of what makes a particular part of the coral reef a better/worse place for a <i>Coryphopterus</i> to live I used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create 3D reef models which I then used to model the distribution of <i>Coryphopterus</i> on the reef.\n\n<br><br><br><br>\n\n***\n\n### **How do <i>Coryphopterus hyalinus</i> and <i>C. personatus</i> maintain species boundaries despite living together?**\n\n<i>Coryphopterus hyalinus</i> and <i>C. personatus</i> both look remarkably similar and they both live spread throughout the Caribbean with nearly entirely overlapping depth distributions and are seemingly the same ecologically. So, why are they two separate species? Do they hybridize much? Initially, I hypothesized that in areas of distributional overlap they would live in distinct shoals spread across the reef, so while at a macro-scale they were overlapping, and a micro-scale they were actually spatially isolated. This turns out not to be the case (in review in Marine Biology). However, despite living on top of each other we find very little evidence of wide-spread hybridization. So what is the mechanism maintaining this species boundary, and what does that teach us about speciation?\n\n<table class=\"image\" align=\"center\">\n<caption align=\"bottom\"></caption>\n<tr><td><img src=\"images/COPE_ClearStain_3.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"500\" style=\"padding: 10px\"></td></tr>\n</table>\n \n***\n\n",
