He then worked as a research assistant at the [Cape Eleuthera Institute](http://www.ceibahamas.org/) performing research on the effects of invasive lionfish on native fish communities. He started working with Dr. [Derek Hogan](https://derekhoganresearch.wordpress.com/) at [TAMUCC](https://tamucc.edu/) for his MS. Initially he planned to study if lionfish act as a strong selective pressure on native fishes.
