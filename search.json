    "text": "How is Dispersal Influenced by the Local Environment\n\n\n\nHabitat Quality (top) and Heterogeneity (bottom) influencing Dispersal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main focus of my dissertation is to understand how the local habitat influences dispersal dynamics. I am using Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus as a model system to understand these dynamics because, despite being generally poorly studied these two species contain characteristics making them an ideal study system for these questions. Namely, an abundant, short-lived sedentary adult life-history combined with generally localized dispersal behaviour.\n\n\n\nWhat are the evolutionary impacts of living near close relatives?\n\n\n\nFamily Networks of C. hyalinus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the instigating findings leading me to use Coryphopterus as a study system to understand dispersal processes is finding in my MS work that there are many close relatives living much closer together than was previously anticipated. This finding has also led to another research interest of mine, what are the consequences of living with close relatives, good and bad? \n\n\nWhat is “good quality” habitat from the perspective of Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus?\n\n\n\n3D Model Belizean Reef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of understanding how habitat quality influences dispersal is to first understand what counts as “good” habitat from the perspective of the Coryphopterus themselves. To try and get a fish eye view of what makes a particular part of the coral reef a better/worse place for a Coryphopterus to live I used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create 3D reef models which I then used to model the distribution of Coryphopterus on the reef.\n\n\n\nHow do Coryphopterus hyalinus and C. personatus maintain species boundaries despite living together?\nCoryphopterus hyalinus and C. personatus both look remarkably similar and they both live spread throughout the Caribbean with nearly entirely overlapping depth distributions and are seemingly the same ecologically. So, why are they two separate species? Do they hybridize much? Initially, I hypothesized that in areas of distributional overlap they would live in distinct shoals spread across the reef, so while at a macro-scale they were overlapping, and a micro-scale they were actually spatially isolated. This turns out not to be the case (Selwyn et al. 2022). However, despite living on top of each other we find very little evidence of wide-spread hybridization. So what is the mechanism maintaining this species boundary, and what does that teach us about speciation?"

    "text": "Jason earned his BS in Biology from Northeastern University. He then worked as a research assistant at the Cape Eleuthera Institute performing research on the effects of invasive lionfish on native fish communities. He started working with Dr. Derek Hogan at TAMUCC for his MS. Initially he planned to study if lionfish act as a strong selective pressure on native fishes. However, after what, in restrospect, was a fortunate series of events he transitioned to researching family groupings in Coryphopterus personatus. Realizing the abundance and presence of relatives in the same area makes for an interesting study species to look at dispersal and how the environment influences dispersal Jason decided to continue working with Derek at TAMUCC for his PhD to look into these questions.\njdselwyn(at)gmail(dot)com"
