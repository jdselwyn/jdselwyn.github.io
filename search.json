    "text": "Jason Selwyn\n\n\nHello!\n\n\nI’m currently an Associate Research Scientist leading bioinformatics analyses at the Genomics CORE Laboratory at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. My research expertise encompasses marine genomics, evolutionary biology, and bioinformatics, with recent projects focusing on using eDNA and metabarcoding to characterize species distributions and diets, and whole genomic analyses to understand the influence of fishing on selective pressures and morphometric changes in targeted populations.\n\n\nPreviously, as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Marine Science Center at Northeastern University in Dr. Steve Vollmer’s lab, I used genomic and transcriptomic approaches to understand coral holobiont responses to White Band Disease in endangered Caribbean staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis). This included identifying genomic signatures associated with disease resistance and pathogen identification using advanced genomic techniques and machine learning.\n\n\nI completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, where my dissertation explored the interplay between habitat quality and dispersal dynamics in Caribbean reef gobies (Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus).\n\n\nCurrently, I serve as an Associate Research Scientist managing bioinformatic analyses for the Genomics CORE Laboratory at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, and I’m passionate about leveraging genomic tools and advanced statistical techniques to address critical questions in marine conservation and ecosystem health."

    "text": "I occasionally work as a statistical consultant on various projects, typically in the general areas of ecology and evolution. If you’d like to work with me please reach out to me and tell me what question’s you’re interested in answering and how I could possibly help improve your ability to answer those questions. Below are some of the people/organizations I have worked with and brief descriptions and links to some outcomes of the collaboration.\n\n\nSouthern Flounder Larval Development with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department\n\nPerform analyses to determine optimal salinity and temperature conditions in which to raise larval southern flounder\nIdentify differentially expressed genes in male and female southern flounder and analyze seasonal changes in expression levels\nIdentify experimental, methodological, environmental, and diet based factors associated with malpigmentation in developing southern flounder\n\nMetabolomic Predictors of Antibiotic Production\n\nUse non-antibiotic metabolic data to understand the amount of antibiotics produced by local subsurface microbes Mullis et al. in prep. In particular I used best subsets and lasso regressions to understand the relationship between non-antibiotic metabolites and microbial antibiotic production in a global set of samples accounting for sequencing/sampling effort.\n\n\n\n\nGeochemical/Microbial/Metabolic Associations in the Mariana Trench subsurface sediment layer\n\nThe extreme conditions found within the seafloor at the deepest part of the ocean provide a great insight into microbial life in the extremes Mullis et al. 2023. In particular using Canonical Correspondance Analyses to understand how geochemical features of the marine subsurface influence microbial metabolite production.\n\nNueces County/City of Corpus Christi/TAMUCC COVID Task Force\n\nLocalize and implement various COVID models (particularly the ICL model) during the early stages of the pandemic to inform the local government and populace of the disease dynamics locally. At the height of the pandemic these were broadcast weekly across various news organizations in the Coastal Bend (e.g. September 29, 2020)\n\n\n\n\nUse of Drones to Estimate Wildlife Counts on Spanish Farms with In-Nova Centro de Innovación\nBathymetric correlates of Humpback Whale singing behaviour\n\nHumpback whales are known to sing to communicate with each other. Using a variety of data collection methods and identification of Humpback whale groupings we were able to find that single male singing Humpbacks near Puerto Rico tend to associate with the shelf edge of an underwater canyon possibly using the canyon to amplify their song in an effort to attract mates MacKay et al. 2016. In particular I used a multinomial logistic regression to explain Humpback whale behavior with various local bathymetric and environmental variables."

    "text": "Jason earned his BS in Biology from Northeastern University. He then worked as a research assistant at the Cape Eleuthera Institute performing research on the effects of invasive lionfish on native fish communities. He started working with Dr. Derek Hogan at TAMUCC for his MS. Initially he planned to study if lionfish act as a strong selective pressure on native fishes. However, after what, in restrospect, was a fortunate series of events he transitioned to researching family groupings in Coryphopterus personatus. Realizing the abundance and presence of relatives in the same area makes for an interesting study species to look at dispersal and how the environment influences dispersal Jason decided to continue working with Derek at TAMUCC for his PhD to look into these questions.\njdselwyn(at)gmail(dot)com"

    "text": "How is Dispersal Influenced by the Local Environment\n\n\nHabitat Quality (top), Heterogeneity (middle) influencing Dispersal, and 3D Model Belizean Reef (bottom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my primary research intersts is understanding how the local habitat influences dispersal dynamics. I am using Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus as a model system to understand these dynamics because, despite being generally poorly studied these two species contain characteristics making them an ideal study system for these questions. Namely, an abundant, short-lived sedentary adult life-history combined with generally localized dispersal behaviour. Part of understanding how habitat quality influences dispersal is to first understand what counts as “good” habitat from the perspective of the Coryphopterus themselves. To try and get a fish eye view of what makes a particular part of the coral reef a better/worse place for a Coryphopterus to live I used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create 3D reef models which I then used to model the distribution of Coryphopterus on the reef."
