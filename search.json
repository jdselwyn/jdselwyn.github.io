    "text": "How is Dispersal Influenced by the Local Environment\n\n\n\nHabitat Quality (top) and Heterogeneity (bottom) influencing Dispersal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main focus of my dissertation is to understand how the local habitat influences dispersal dynamics. I am using Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus as a model system to understand these dynamics because, despite being generally poorly studied these two species contain characteristics making them an ideal study system for these questions. Namely, an abundant, short-lived sedentary adult life-history combined with generally localized dispersal behaviour.\n\n\n\nWhat are the evolutionary impacts of living near close relatives?\n\n\n\nFamily Networks of C. hyalinus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the instigating findings leading me to use Coryphopterus as a study system to understand dispersal processes is finding in my MS work that there are many close relatives living much closer together than was previously anticipated. This finding has also led to another research interest of mine, what are the consequences of living with close relatives, good and bad? \n\n\nWhat is “good quality” habitat from the perspective of Coryphopterus hyalinus/personatus?\n\n\n\n3D Model Belizean Reef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of understanding how habitat quality influences dispersal is to first understand what counts as “good” habitat from the perspective of the Coryphopterus themselves. To try and get a fish eye view of what makes a particular part of the coral reef a better/worse place for a Coryphopterus to live I used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create 3D reef models which I then used to model the distribution of Coryphopterus on the reef.\n\n\n\nHow do Coryphopterus hyalinus and C. personatus maintain species boundaries despite living together?\nCoryphopterus hyalinus and C. personatus both look remarkably similar and they both live spread throughout the Caribbean with nearly entirely overlapping depth distributions and are seemingly the same ecologically. So, why are they two separate species? Do they hybridize much? Initially, I hypothesized that in areas of distributional overlap they would live in distinct shoals spread across the reef, so while at a macro-scale they were overlapping, and a micro-scale they were actually spatially isolated. This turns out not to be the case (Selwyn et al. 2022). However, despite living on top of each other we find very little evidence of wide-spread hybridization. So what is the mechanism maintaining this species boundary, and what does that teach us about speciation?"

    "text": "I’m mostly testing out Quarto features and seeing how things render based on this tutorial. For some example data/something to work with I’m using this reddit post comparing estimated catch per unit effort (CPUE) of a target fishery based on two different survey techniques. The provided data is the mean daily CPUE for each day of the week for each survey type. We’ll assume these techniques were conducted in parallel and treat this as paired data with the goal Census and Roving methods to estimate the same “true” CPUE on a given day. As such we’ll use a paired T-Test for the analysis and do the same analysis three different ways.\n\nPaired T-Test\nBootstrap\nBayesian\n\nFirst we’ll load the libraries we want to use for the analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(magrittr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nNext create the dataframe in the format from the post and then convert to a generally more R friendly tidy format.\n\n\nCode\nthe_data &lt;- tibble(day = factor(c(\"Saturday\", \"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \n                                  \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"),\n                                levels = c(\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \n                                           \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\",\n                                           \"Saturday\")), \n                   census_mean_cpue = c(1.156, 0.165, 0.766, 1.345, 1.010, 1.221, 0.98),\n                   roving_mean_cpue = c(0.217457, 0.113493, 0, 0.195091, 0.208608, 0.25817, 0.119578))\n\nlong_data &lt;- the_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with('cpue'),\n               names_to = 'survey_method',\n               values_to = 'cpue') %&gt;%\n  mutate(survey_method = str_extract(survey_method, 'census|roving'),\n         survey_method = str_to_sentence(survey_method))\n\n\nLets see what we’re looking at!\n\n\nCode\nlong_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = survey_method, y = cpue, colour = day)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.25) +\n  labs(title = 'Surveying Fisheries',\n       subtitle = 'Estimated catch varies by survey type',\n       caption = 'Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/fgkm5m\\nDate: 10-March-2020',\n       x = 'Survey Method',\n       y = 'Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE)',\n       colour = 'Day of Week') + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 4))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18),\n        plot.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 20),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 16),\n        panel.border = element_rect(colour = 'black', fill = 'transparent'),\n        legend.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18))\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there is probably a fairly large difference between the census method and the roving method in estimating the CPUE on any given day.\nNow that we have the data setup and have looked at the raw data lets analyze it to see if the difference we observe is statistically significant. First we’ll use one of the first tests learned in most statistics classes, a (paired) T-Test.\n\n\nCode\nthe_t_test &lt;- with(the_data, t.test(census_mean_cpue, roving_mean_cpue, paired = TRUE))\n\nthe_t_test\n\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  census_mean_cpue and roving_mean_cpue\nt = 5.9826, df = 6, p-value = 0.0009793\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4669396 1.1132326\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      0.7900861 \n\n\nIt looks like there is a significant (p = 0.00098) difference between the estimates reported for the two survey methods. The average difference in CPUE between the two methods is ~0.79 CPUE. One thing that I like to include in plots is confidence intervals of various plotted means. Since we want to plot the mean CPUE from each survey method we’ll calculate those intervals using a mirrored method to how we test if there is a significant difference (eg. here with two T based confidence intervals).\n\n\nCode\nmethod_T &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  nest(data = -survey_method) %&gt;%\n  mutate(t_test = map(data, ~t.test(.x$cpue)),\n         t_test = map(t_test, tidy)) %&gt;%\n  select(-data) %&gt;%\n  unnest(t_test)\n\n\nNow we can finally plot the results and visualize the difference in survey methodology.\n\n\nCode\nannotation_t_results &lt;- the_t_test %&gt;%\n  tidy() %$%\n  str_c('atop(t','[(', parameter, ')]', ' == ', round(statistic, 3), ', p == ', round(p.value, 3),')', sep = '')\n\nt_plot &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = survey_method)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = cpue, group = day, colour = day), linewidth = 0.5) +\n  \n  geom_errorbar(data = method_T, aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), \n                 linetype = 'solid', size = 1, width = 0.05) +\n  geom_point(data = method_T, aes(y = estimate), size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = Inf, vjust = 1.5, \n           label = annotation_t_results, parse = TRUE, size = 4) +\n  labs(title = 'Surveying Fisheries',\n       subtitle = 'Estimated catch varies by survey type',\n       caption = 'Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/fgkm5m\\nDate: 10-March-2020\\nAnalysis: Paired T-Test\\nIntervals: T-Test 95%',\n       x = 'Survey Method',\n       y = 'Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE)',\n       colour = 'Day of Week') + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 4))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18),\n        plot.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 20),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 16),\n        panel.border = element_rect(colour = 'black', fill = 'transparent'),\n        legend.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18))\nt_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets repeat that analysis using a bootstrap appraoch to see if there is evidence of significant differences.\n\n\nCode\npaired_boot &lt;- function(){\n  the_data[sample(7, replace = TRUE),] %&gt;%\n    summarise(mean_diff = mean(census_mean_cpue - roving_mean_cpue)) %&gt;%\n    pull(mean_diff)\n}\nboot_diffs &lt;- replicate(1000, paired_boot())\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmethod_boot &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  nest(data = -survey_method) %&gt;%\n  mutate(boot = map(data, ~replicate(1000, mean(sample(.x$cpue, nrow(.x), replace = TRUE))))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(estimate = map_dbl(boot, mean),\n         conf.low = map_dbl(boot, quantile, 0.025),\n         conf.high = map_dbl(boot, quantile, 0.975))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nannotation_boot_results &lt;- str_c('Census - Roving CPUE: ', \n                                 round(mean(boot_diffs), 3), '\\n(95% CI: ',\n      str_c(round(quantile(boot_diffs, c(0.025, 0.975)), 3), collapse = '-'),\n      ')')\n\nboot_plot &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = survey_method)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = cpue, group = day, colour = day), linewidth = 0.5) + #, colour = 'gray60'\n  # geom_point(aes(y = count), size = 1, colour = 'gray60') +\n  \n  geom_errorbar(data = method_boot, aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), \n                 linetype = 'solid', size = 1, width = 0.05) +\n  geom_point(data = method_boot, aes(y = estimate), size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = Inf, vjust = 1.5, \n           label = annotation_boot_results, parse = FALSE, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = 'Surveying Fisheries',\n       subtitle = 'Estimated catch varies by survey type',\n       caption = 'Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/fgkm5m\\nDate: 10-March-2020\\nAnalysis: Paired Bootstrap\\nIntervals: Bootstrap 95%',\n       x = 'Survey Method',\n       y = 'Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE)',\n       colour = 'Day of Week') + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 4))) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        axis.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18),\n        plot.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 20),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 16),\n        panel.border = element_rect(colour = 'black', fill = 'transparent'),\n        legend.text = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 12),\n        legend.title = element_text(colour = 'black', size = 18))\nboot_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, lets use a Bayesian method.
