just centers the image vertically and horizontally within the screen\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat; means if the screen is too big that the image can't take up the whole thing, don't repeat the image\nbackground-size: cover is what makes this image cover the entire width of the screen\nbackground-attachment: fixed; is kind of complicated but means that is there is enough text that the screen needs to scroll, keep the image fixed in it's place aka don't scroll with the text -->\n\n<!-- body { -->\n<!--    color: black;

sets the background of the body to be a light grey (hex code 211, 211, 211) with an alpha (transparency) value of .7 (70% opaque) -->\n\n<!-- @media screen and (max-width: 480px) { -->\n<!--     html { -->\n<!--      background: url(images/virgatus_thin.jpg);

My research focuses on understanding the interaction between habitat quality and dispersal dynamics in the Caribbean reef gobies <i>Coryphopterus hyalinus</i>/<i>personatus</i>.\n\n<!-- the text above is all normal body text which is styled first by the css formatting contained within this web page as discussed above (currently formats placement, background color) and second by the formatting contained in the style.css (currently formats font type and font size)-->\n<!--note the [] encase a set of words that are hyperlinked by the following link contained within the () -->\n",
